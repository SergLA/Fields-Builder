Fields-Builder
==============

Provides possibility to build iOS UI based on xml data. 

At several projects I faced with necessity to build simple UI that contains fields. At first look this is simple task, but when we need to change displaying fields on customer demand during developing and/or need to change fields representation in depend of some server state or value of some parameter this task becomes nightmare.

This simple application provides example of how we can build UI using just simple xml file (actually, two files - one for fields and other for metadata).
